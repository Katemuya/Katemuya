# The beginning of it all
Welcome to ny first readme file. 
It is bound to be mediocre but bear with me for now. 
In a couple of commits it will look more polished and with that represent me better.

I am a curious and adventerous 30 year old. 
My adventurous side brought me to Germany at the age of 19. 
I was still very naive but one must say brave.
11 years later I am still open to learning and growing. 
Hence why I start this wonderful journey of programming.
